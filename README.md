Infinispan messages history,<br/>
is never more a mystery.<br/>

Meet InfiSpector, say hello!<br/>
He monitors that data flow.<br/>
Send the entries, let it grow,<br/>
InfiSpector makes the show! 

#### What is InfiSpector:

Our intention is to graphically represent JGroups communication 
happening between Infinispan nodes in a cluster to help users and developers 
better understand what's happening inside during data replication/distribution.

#### How to run the application:

'npm install'

'npm start'
